For children living in conflict, education has become even more dangerous
A childâ€™s right to education cannot be safeguarded in conflict zones without education itself being protected. 
Education can be a lifesaver. 
Out of school, children are easy targets of abuse, exploitation and recruitment by armed forces and groups. 
In 2020, there was an increase of 17 per cent on attacks on schools compared to 2019. 
The International Day to Protect Education from Attack (9 September) brings attention to the importance of safeguarding schools as places of protection and safety for students and educators and the need to keep education at the top of the public agenda.
Safe Schools Declaration
The Safe Schools Declaration was opened for state endorsement in Oslo, Norway, in May 2015. 
It is a political commitment to better protect students, teachers, schools and universities during armed conflict, to support the continuation of education during war, and to put in place concrete measures to deter the military use of schools. 
By endorsing the Declaration, States commit to restoring access to safe education and to developing education systems that are conflict-sensitive and promote respect between social or ethnic groups.
